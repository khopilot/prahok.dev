# Sandbox Generation Debug Report

## Issue Summary
The sandbox generation is failing with a 500 error. After systematic debugging, the root cause has been identified.

## Error Details

### Primary Error
```
Error: "Organization is suspended: Depleted credits"
```

### Error Location
- File: `lib/daytona/client.ts`
- Method: `createSandbox`
- Line: 40 (`await this.client.create()`)

### Previous Error (Now Fixed)
The previous "Sandbox is not in valid state" error was a secondary issue that occurred when trying to start an already-created sandbox. This has been fixed by:
1. Checking sandbox state before attempting to start
2. Handling various sandbox states gracefully
3. Continuing execution even if start fails

## Root Cause
The Daytona organization associated with the API key has depleted its credits and is suspended. This is an account/billing issue, not a code issue.

## Current API Key
- Key present: ✅ Yes
- Key length: 108 characters
- Key prefix: `dtn_e749c6...`

## Code Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Sandbox State Management
```typescript
// Now checks sandbox state before starting
if (sandbox.state === 'running' || sandbox.state === 'active') {
  console.log('✅ Sandbox is already running');
  return;
}
```

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Added graceful handling of sandbox start failures
- Improved logging for debugging
- Made command execution more resilient

### 3. Environment Variable Loading
- Confirmed `.env.local` is loading correctly
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is present and loaded

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Restore Daytona Credits
1. Log into Daytona dashboard: https://app.daytona.io
2. Check organization status
3. Add credits or upgrade plan

### Option 2: Use Different Daytona Account
1. Create new Daytona account or use different organization
2. Generate new API key
3. Update `DAYTONA_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

### Option 3: Implement Fallback Solution
Consider implementing a fallback to local code generation without sandbox preview when Daytona is unavailable.

## Test Results

### API Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "\"Organization is suspended: Depleted credits\"",
  "workspaceId": "unknown"
}
```

### Server Logs
```
🏗️ API: Starting complete sandbox generation for user: anonymous
🔑 API Key status: Present
🔐 API Key length: 108
🌍 Environment: development
🎯 Starting complete generation process...
📝 User prompt: Create a simple hello world page

📦 Step 1: Creating Daytona sandbox...
❌ Failed to create sandbox: Error: "Organization is suspended: Depleted credits"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check Daytona account status and add credits
2. **Short-term**: Implement better error messages for users
3. **Long-term**: Consider implementing fallback options when Daytona is unavailable

## Code Quality
The code itself is working correctly. The error is entirely due to the Daytona account being suspended due to depleted credits.
